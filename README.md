# EA

Exercises for the evolutionary algorithms course at DHBW Mannheim in summer term 2017.
The objective is to solve an optimization problem (minimizing the [ackley function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ackley_function)) using different algorithms.

## Implemented Optimizers

- a vanilla hill climber for comparison
- a generic algorithms using class bit-wise cross-over, mutation and recombination
- evolutionary strategy algorithms

## How to run

```
go get github.com/aaarne/ea
go run ea_demo.go
```
